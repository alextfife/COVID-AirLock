# COVID-AirLock
Dental Office Air Filter Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Activation Switch. Inspired by the events of COVID-19.

<h2>Where did this come from?</h2>
A small minority of dental offices peppered around the United States in the early 2000's for independent dental practices have a similar system installed within their buildings that allow for air filtration per room, and in most cases, per 'area'. That is, it would be an inlet with 3 walls but no door, thus no closed in air source. Due to bad breath, debris from dental procedures, and sick patients, these filters were installed.

This filtration system is based almost completely on the saw dust collection filters that are installed at sawmills. However at a sawmill the power cost is astronomical due to all the vacuums being on for older systems. Newer systems use switches to activate which vacuum tubes receive suction, and to power on the vacuum.

During the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020-present, many dental offices are trying to implement this system now. 

<h2>So what is this project?</h2>
This github page is the evolution of the activator switch. The switch uses a sinusoidal signal to activate both the room's individual vacuum, and to open the aperature for that 'room's tube. 

<h2>Evolution</h2>
The switches are not my original design. The original design is without patent, and the manufacturer actually never mass produced them. The switch activator I used is based on ones made for a few select dental offices 20+ years ago. 
<h3>Some issues with the old, 'prototype' design. </h3>
<ol><li>It took AA batteries</li>
<li>The batteries corroded a lot and most units were switched out or bricks</li>
<li>The board itself had no seal or protection for components, and the copper on many of them was oxidizing.</li>
<li>There is no way to know when the switch had power or was dead until you took apart the switch socket.</li>
<li>The board itself is wider (by a small margin) than the footprint of the switch itself.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Design Evolution</h3>
The original design. None of this was of my doing.
